# EmbryoData

## Processed *scRNAseq* timecourse data along mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis

This package contains the processed 10X Genomics data from Pijuan-Sala et al. (2019), which were processed as described in the paper, and at its repository [on Github](https://github.com/MarioniLab/EmbryoTimecourse2018/).
This includes gene counts, cell annotation, and reduced-dimension representations, which are stored as a `SingleCellExperiment` object.
