# MouseGastrulationData

## Processed *scRNAseq* timecourse data along mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis

This package contains the processed 10X Genomics data from Pijuan-Sala et al. (2019), which were processed as described in the paper, and at its repository [on Github](https://github.com/MarioniLab/EmbryoTimecourse2018/).
This includes gene counts, cell annotation, and reduced-dimension representations for the atlas, which are stored as a `SingleCellExperiment` object.

## Processed *scRNAseq* data of chimeric embryos

Data for chimeric embryos, also generated for Pijuan-Sala et al. (2019), are available via this package, presented in a similar manner to the atlas data.
These include the *Tal1*<sup>-/-</sup>/wild-type and wild-type/wild-type chimaeras.
